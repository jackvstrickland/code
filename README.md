# code

Hi, I'm Jack Strickland, an aspiring software developer currently attending Louisiana Tech University.
This is my new github account, I created it because my old one was too unorganized and done through a series.

I am going to post my code which includes personal and class projects. I will also be posting my implementation of algorithms and data structures as practice and personal reference.
